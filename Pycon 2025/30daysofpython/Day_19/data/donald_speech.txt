My fellow Americans, we live in the greatest country in the world. No one builds, innovates, and creates like we do. The American spirit is unmatched. We have the best workers, the best companies, and the most powerful economy on Earth—and we’re going to keep it that way.

When I took office, I promised to put America first. That meant bringing jobs back home, making trade deals that actually work for our people, and making sure American businesses could compete on a level playing field. We cut taxes, removed unnecessary regulations, and unleashed the incredible potential of the American worker.

The results speak for themselves. We saw record job growth. We saw wages rise for the first time in decades. Factories started coming back. Companies began investing in our country again, because they knew America was open for business.

But our success isn’t just about numbers—it’s about people. It’s about the families who now have more money in their pockets, the small business owners who can finally hire more employees, the young graduates who are finding opportunities right here at home instead of having to look overseas.

We’ve also rebuilt our military so it is stronger than ever. We support our veterans, we stand by our law enforcement, and we protect our borders. Because a strong America is a safe America.

Of course, there are challenges ahead. The world is changing fast. But I know that with the determination and grit of the American people, there is nothing we cannot overcome. We are problem-solvers. We are innovators. And we never, ever give up.

I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished together, but I’m even more excited about what’s next. We’re going to continue to grow our economy, invest in infrastructure, and make sure our children inherit a nation that is even stronger than the one we have today.

Together, we will keep America prosperous, we will keep America safe, and we will keep America great.

Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
