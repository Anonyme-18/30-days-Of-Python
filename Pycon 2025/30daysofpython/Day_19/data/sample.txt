The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
Life is what happens when you are busy making other plans.
In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity.
Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success.
Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
To love and be loved is the greatest happiness of all.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies,
but the silence of our friends.
