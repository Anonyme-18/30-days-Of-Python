Good evening. I am honored to be here with all of you tonight. As I look around this room, I see people from different walks of life, different backgrounds, and different experiences. And yet, we are united by our shared values—compassion, respect, and the belief that kindness can change the world.

I have always believed that kindness is not a sign of weakness—it is a sign of strength. It takes courage to treat others with respect, especially when they do not treat you the same way. It takes strength to listen, to understand, and to forgive.

In my travels, I have met children who have endured great hardship, families who have lost everything, and communities that have been devastated by disaster. And yet, in each of these places, I have also seen incredible generosity. I have seen people open their homes to strangers, share their last meal, and give their time to help those in need.

This is the spirit we must nurture—not just in times of crisis, but every single day. It begins with small acts. A smile. A kind word. A helping hand. These things may seem small, but they create a ripple effect that can reach farther than we imagine.

I encourage each of you to look for ways to make a difference in your own community. Volunteer at a local school. Support a charity you believe in. Be there for a neighbor who is struggling. These are the things that make our communities stronger and our world better.

Let us also remember the importance of teaching kindness to our children. They are watching us. They learn from our words, but even more from our actions. When we show them that kindness matters, we shape the future.

So tonight, I leave you with this thought: In a world where you can be anything, choose to be kind. Because kindness has the power to heal, to unite, and to inspire.

Thank you, and may your kindness light the way for others.
