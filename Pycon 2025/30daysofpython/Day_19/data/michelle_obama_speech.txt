Good evening everyone. I’m here tonight because I believe in the power of education, the importance of opportunity, and the incredible potential within every young person in this country. I believe that where you come from should never determine where you end up, and that no dream is too big if you’re willing to work for it.

When I was a little girl growing up on the South Side of Chicago, we didn’t have much. My parents worked hard, but we lived modestly. What they gave me, though, was far more valuable than money—they gave me their belief in my ability to succeed. They told me that if I stayed focused, worked hard, and treated people with respect, I could accomplish anything.

That’s why I speak to young people every chance I get. Because I want them to know they matter. I want them to know that their voices are important, that their ideas can change the world, and that their future is worth fighting for.

But here’s the thing—success doesn’t come overnight. It comes from small, consistent steps. It comes from choosing to do the right thing, even when it’s the hard thing. It comes from surrounding yourself with people who lift you up, not those who pull you down.

Education is not just about grades or degrees—it’s about learning how to think critically, how to question the world around you, and how to make informed choices. It’s about developing the skills you need to be a leader in your community, in your workplace, and in your own life.

And let me tell you, leadership isn’t about titles or positions. It’s about service. It’s about using whatever influence you have to make life better for others. Sometimes that’s as simple as helping a classmate who’s struggling. Sometimes it’s about standing up for someone who doesn’t have a voice.

We also have to remember that empowerment is not just for ourselves—it’s for those around us. When you lift others up, you lift yourself up. When you create opportunities for others, you build a stronger community.

So I challenge each of you tonight to believe in your own power. To invest in your education, to speak up for what’s right, and to never stop dreaming. Because when you believe in yourself, and when you work hard every day, you will be amazed at what you can accomplish.

Thank you, and keep reaching higher.
